# Natural Language Processing

This repository contains a collection of mini Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects that I've created while learning NLP.

## Project 1: Movie Review Classifier

### Overview
The "Movie Review Classifier" project is designed to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It employs a Naive Bayes classifier and NLTK library for text analysis.

### Project Code
You can find the code for this project in the `movie-review-classifier` directory.

### Project Dependencies
- Python
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- 'punkt' and 'movie_reviews' datasets (downloaded via NLTK)

### Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `movie-review-classifier` directory.
3. Run the `main.py` script to execute the movie review classifier.

### Features
- Sentiment analysis of movie reviews.
- Naive Bayes classification.
- User input for real-time sentiment analysis.
- Training and testing on the Movie Reviews dataset from NLTK.
